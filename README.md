## How it Works

Design at MDPI (1x) size, NOT support for other sizes.

You need to create new asset from selected layers, by run "Plugins" - "Android Res Export" - "New ...", then run "Export ..." to export them. while you have selected layers, the export feature will only export the layer which is selected, and deselected all to export all assets in current document.

For export bitmap and nine-patch assets, you can choose what dpi will exported in "Android Res Export" - "Preferences" dialog.
